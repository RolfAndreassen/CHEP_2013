\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Parameter estimation is a crucial part of many physics analyses. 
GooFit is an interface between the MINUIT minimisation algorithm
and a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which allows a probability
density function (PDF) to be evaluated in parallel, that is, for
several hundred events at once. Since PDF evaluation on large datasets
is usually the bottleneck in the MINUIT algorithm, this can result
in speedups of up to $\sim 200$ in real problems - which can be the
difference between waiting overnight for the answer, or making a cup
of tea.
