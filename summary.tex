\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

We have developed GooFit for use in real-world physics problems, 
and have achieved speedups of $\sim 200$ in particular analyses. 
We believe that we have created a robust framework that is easy
to use for a new graduate student, but flexible enough that the
most advanced analyses will find it useful.
