\section{Program flow and organisation}
\label{sec:flow}

This section should contain a diagram of the various GooFit modules,
plus the GPU and MINUIT (perhaps as literally black boxes). Also
an explanation in text of what the various things do. Then, a flow 
diagram of how the numbers pass back and forth during a fit.
