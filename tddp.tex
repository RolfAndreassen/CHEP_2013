\section{Real-world example: Time-dependent Dalitz-plot fit}
\label{sec:tddp}

To ensure the usefulness of GooFit in real-world physics problems,
we have, simultaneously with developing GooFit, used it as our fitting
tool in a time-dependent Dalitz-plot analysis of the decay $D^0\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$. 
This fit has been our ``driver'' for GooFit, in that every
time we needed a feature for the physics, we added it to the GooFit
engine. 

This mixing fit is rather complex, involving, for the signal component, 
16 complex resonances to describe the Dalitz-plot distribution,
a time component where hyperbolic and trigonometric functions
are convolved with Gaussian resolution functions, and a distribution
of the uncertainty $\sigma_t$ on the decay time which varies across
the Dalitz plot. All in all there are about 40 free parameters in the
fit, and the data set is roughly a hundred thousand events; running this
on a modern CPU takes between ten and twenty hours, depending on the 
data. Using GooFit this is reduced to a much more comfortable 3-5 \emph{minutes},
a speedup factor in the region of 200.
